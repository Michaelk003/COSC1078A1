      <h1>Welcome To Michael's Website!</h1>
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>

        <p>Name: Michael Maher Khalil</p>
        <p>Student ID: s3944778</p>
        <p>Email: s3944778@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

        <p>Hi, I'm Michael and welcome to My Profile!</p>

          <p>I'm currently 18 years of age as of 2022 and just finished highschool last year completing VCE. As of this year I am currently enrolled at RMIT Melbourne studying my first year for my  Bachelor of Information technology degree.<p>
          <p> was born here in Australia but both sides of my family came from Egypt, with both my parents moving from Egypt to Melbourne as migrants. Because of my constant exposure to Egyptian culture and the Arabic language, I understand spoken Arabic vaguely (but cant read it!) and can barely speak it. Through primary and high school I also know basic Italian.<p>
          <p>My hobbies and interests include, Video Games, computer hardware, IT as a whole, japanese cars and modifying them, as well as motorsports in general (especially Formula 1!), and even a bit of anime.<p>
          <p>The culmination of these interests can be summarised through my great appreciation of Initial D, it was my first anime that i watched in its entirety, which is based around the illegal japanese mountain pass street racing scene that was popular in the 90s, and contains many  recognizable cars that are still sought after to this day.<p>
          <p>This show alone made me more interested in Japanese cars, motorsports, and was my introduction to anime and I am currently rewatching all the seasons with a friend who also shares similar interests.</p>

        <h2>Intrest in IT</h2>

          <p>My interest in IT started at a very young age through Video Games on my family desktop computer running Windows XP. I fondly remember spending a reasonable amount of time in my early childhood playing flash games on various websites and using the Microsoft Office suite for homework. At the time I took them for granted but in that age of curiosity I wanted to know more about computers and how they work. It was this curiosity and fascination that sparked my interest and eventually my passion for computers and IT as a whole.</p>

          <p>Since then my interest in IT has expanded to a variety of fields such as:</p>

            <h3>The Consumer Electronic Market</h3>

              <p>From phones, wearable technologies, virtual assistants, or even a niche product designed to make people's lives easier, The constant innovations that are made in this field are fascinating and are things most people take for granted.</p>

            <h3>Computer Enthusiast Hardware</h3>

              <p>Despite making an enthusiast computer for gaming around 4 years ago, I’ve still shown a great amount of interest in the rapidly evolving enthusiast market. This kind of hardware is needed for the intensive loads that are needed to run games and other applications at their best. In the period of four years since I built my computer, hardware has improved at an unprecedented rate with consumer CPUs with greatly increased core counts, GPUs with Larger amounts of VRAM and innovations like raytracing (which have become increasingly more volatile and expensive due to their scarcity). It's these types of developments that keep me engaged with the enthusiast computer hardware market, with me expecting more performance with each flagship release.</p>

            <h3>Programing and Back End Development</h3>

              <p>Through High School, I learnt Visual Basic and a variety of fundamentals used in the IT industry through my VCE software development course. I found it quite enjoyable and being a programer or a back end developer of any kind is the kind of career i'm looking towards pursuing</p>

            <h3>Gaming</h3>

              <p>This is pretty self explanatory, my first encounter with an IT based application was a computer game, so it clearly grew on me as i'm still an avid gamer (and it will probably remain that way). With the skills I can develop through uni, I wouldn't mind trying to dive into the game development world and making my own game.</p>

            <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>

              <p>RMIT was an attractive option to study after highschool for a wide range of reasons. Their Bachelor of Information Technology degree was something I wanted to study to help me  pursue a career in IT. The courses' wide range of electives and potential industry based learning pathway means I could explore what I like, and get first hand experience in the industry which could help me find a job after I graduate. Also, I only need to take a train to get to the city campus which doesn’t take that long to commute and is very convenient. The city campus is also a nice location which I find to be vibrant, and after classes, the city has a lot to offer to relax or have a good time.</p>

            <h3> What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>

              <p>During my studies I expect to learn the basics of a wide range of skills that are required for a wide variety of IT jobs. In my first and second semesters I will be exposed to a wide variety of fields relevant to my course. From that I would be able to gauge what I enjoy and select electives in the coming semesters that are relevant to what I like. Hopefully with what I learn I'm able to graduate and fit into the workplace with relative ease with the experience necessary to work efficiently.</p>

        <h2>Ideal Job</h2>

          <p>Judging from the requirements, I will be working with websites and databases and be developing, maintaining and updating them</p>

          <p>I will be required to know HTML, CSS (websites) and APEx (in regard to databases and websites). As well as the REST API (for website guidelines)</p>

          <p>Currently I have very limited knowledge for the requirements that would be acceptable in a professional environment, especially for this position. However, the fundamentals and basics are something I am already learning in my bachelor degree in semester 1. This knowledge can be even further developed to make me understand all relevant fields in detail through later electives in my degree making me a much more skilled individual and making me a much better candidate for the position.</p>

          <p>This is my ideal job in context to when I finish my bachelor degree, and seeking a full time job to make my primary source of income.</p>

          <p>For me personally, this is my ideal job in context to when I finish my bachelor degree, and seeking a full time job to make my primary source of income. It is attractive because:</p>

          <p>HTML and CSS is something I am interested in because web design and creating websites is something I would be interested in pursuing a career in.</p>

          <p>Additionally, the lack of requirement for previous industry experience makes it a good choice for when I finish university, as it would provide me with my first job and is vital for providing me real world industry experience that may be sought after for more senior jobs that require this experience.</p>

          <p>Apart from the actual work, the location of the office is surprisingly close to home, making travel very short and not cumbersome. Apart from that, I would be satisfied with the salary for being a postgraduate with no experience.</p>

        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>

          <h3>Myers-Briggs personality test</h3>

            <p>From this test I conducted online, I got the “Assertive Entertainer” personality. According to this test I am; a very social and energetic person, I am socially aware of the people around me and try to help others in need. I try to live in the moment and make it is enjoyable as possible for myself and the people around me, in an attempt to make the current situation enjoyable, i can sometimes myself lose focus of the task at hand at what is important, because of this i can be impulsive in decision making and be bad at planning, not looking at the long term, in some cases, i struggle to deal with issues head on.</p>

            <p>I think this means in a group, I can keep members motivated and entertained by making the task at hand enjoyable. However, this constant seeking in entertainment can also be a hindrance as I can distract myself and others. Because of good social awareness I can recognise when group members are struggling, and therefore assist them to try and solve the issue before it reaches a point of harm. Because of my lack of planning, constant distractions and short sightedness, being monitored and regularly checked in is probably going to be important in working as a group so that I don't lose track of what is important and fall behind.</p>

            <p>I think when forming a group with my type of personality, I have attributes that can be good and bad for being a leader, and therefore being an assistant leader in a group could be my ideal role when forming a group. I think this is because of my social skills and entertaining nature which can keep members on track when in difficulty and motivated when needed. However, my tendencies to be distracted and shortsighted can make me a bad leader, and as a result having someone superior watching over me can keep me in check </p>

          <h3> Learning Style Test (What's Your Learning Style?)</h3>
              <h4>Results:</h4>

                <ul>
                  <li>10% auditory</li>
                  <li>40% visual</li>
                  <li>50% tactile</li>
                </ul>

            <p>From this test I conducted online, it appears I am primarily a tactile learner, with a visual learner being a significant part of my learning as well.</p>

            <p>By being a tactile learner, learning and absorbing information is best done through activities and not reading and listening. If I was to work in a group, understanding ideas and issues would be best done through me experiencing the issue/idea through  demonstrations and interactive visualisations. This could be an issue when in group work as communication of ideas can be hard for me through basic conversation. When forming a group it is important for me to communicate to my group members that visualisations and demonstrations are best for me to grasp ideas to avoid misunderstandings later down in a project.</p>

          <h3>Big 5 Personality Test</h3>

              <h4>Results:</h4>

                <ul>
                  <li>Openness - 60%</li>
                  <li>Conscientiousness - 48%</li>
                  <li>Extraversion - 62.5%</li>
                  <li>Agreeableness - 65%</li>
                  <li>Neuroticism - 42%</li>
                </ul>

            <p>From the results of this test it appears that I am:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>I am somewhat open, meaning I can think creatively and abstractly while interested in new experiences.</li>
              <li>My conscientiousness is somewhat low, meaning i'm not that self disciplined </li>
              <li>I am somewhat extraverted, so i seek social stimulation and acceptance</li>
              <li>I am also quite agreeable, so i usually prioritise other people's needs and don't argue with people’s decision, additionally I am usually trustworthy and forgiving of others</li>
              <li>My low Neuroticism means I don't regularly feel negative emotions and i'm more likely to brush miss fortune when it occurs</li>
            </ol>

            <i>A lot of these attributes are in line with my results recorded in  the Myers-Briggs personality test</i>

            <p>Due to the fact many of my personality attributes are similar to my Myers-Briggs personality test, there isn't much too to add to what I have already mentioned in my previous tests in regards to how it would influence my behaviour in a team. However my Agreeableness would make me more likely to cooperate in a team and not argue with members when making decisions or changes for a project. With my low neuroticism, failure and setbacks are not that likely to impact me and my work during group work.</p>

            <p>When making groups my personality might not be that much of a hindrance in work, however my agreeableness might make me a bad leader as I can be indecisive with decisions. Also my social nature can be disruptive when working as a team.</p>

        <h2>Project Idea</h2>

          <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>My project is a mobile application that is essentially a virtual wallet designed to be a unified hub for all forms of virtual cards, QR codes and virtual tickets. Because there are many different types of services that can store credit cards (eg: apple pay and google play), some less popular virtual cards are on fewer or only one virtual service, meaning a card holder might need multiple applications and multiple accounts to use all their virtual cards on their phone. This application will be designed so that all these cards and scannable codes can be stored in one place, as a unified eWallet, making a card holder’s life easier and more efficient when dealing with scans on their phone.</p>

          <h3>Motivation</h3>

            <p>This idea has come from personal experiences, with statistics and global trends making this idea more viable. When I make cashless payments, the majority of those transactions are made through Apple pay which I find to be much more convenient than taking out my physical wallet. The only time I need to regularly take out my wallet is when taking public transport to touch on and off my miki, which for me personally is mildly infuriating when we already have these technologies in place in our phones through near field communication (NFC). Although a miki can be stored on mobile through google pay, the inconvenience still stands, having multiple wallet/card applications in my opinion can be less efficient and convenient than a simple physical wallet! </p>

            <p>The solution is simple, people have all their physical cards stored in one wallet, so all that is needed is one application to store everything, not multiple applications. This idea of convenience and practicality is the key motivation for my project. Additionally virtual wallets have become increasingly more adopted with 900 million transactions at the start of the pandemic increasing to almost 1.5 billion in 2021, a 25% increase, which is set to go above 33% in the coming years. The growth has been so large in fact that 45% of all eCommerce transactions were through mobile in 2021, which is twice as large as the payments done via debit cards and three times of debit card payments ¹ .</p>

          <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>The application would have a simple UI, a variety of features and connections to allow for the maximum amount of cards and scanables as possible, while also making the experience using the app as simple as efficient as possible for the user</p>

            <p>The types of cards, scanables and their connections to the application can be separated into classifications that i have designated and can be locally stored and redirected:</p>

              <h4>Internally Supported cards (locally stored)</h4>

                <p> When debit card is located in the app and can be used without exiting the application, and can send a signal through the phone's NFC for a successful transaction, this type of card can be called an internally supported card, in most cases the institution/banks will officially support the card being used in the app as they already do with other major wallets like apple wallet and google pay. This type of classification not only applies to bank cards, but also one time codes and other scannable codes (eg: loyalty reward card and limited time offers) that may be officially supported by the institution in the app.</p>

              <h4>User Inserted Scannable Cards (locally stored)</h4>

                <p>If a scannable item isn't supported by the institution, then the user can take a photo or screenshot of the code and then save it in the wallet, making it so that the code can still be scanned in the app without redirecting to another app or even referring to a physical docket that may have been given to them. This won't be able to work with cards that require NFC to work such as bank cards. However, there is a workaround which will be mentioned next.</p>

              <h4>Redirectable Cards (redirected)</h4>

                <p>If any type of card for whatever reason cannot be saved on the app, there is the option to redirect the user to the source app that the card is on, this can be done through granting permissions to the application to have access to redirecting the user to the specific card stored on that app.</p>

              <h4>App Redirection (redirected)</h4>

                <p>If the redirection direct of cards cannot work, the user can manually set a shortcut to open the app where the desired cards are stored, it may not be as efficient as the other methods, but if a user frequently uses the application this may be used in some cases instead of directly</p>

              <h4>Direct Scan (experimental / questionable legality)</h4>

                <p>
                  With Apple, Google and Samsung announcing their phones can be used as terminals for businesses to accept payments through their NFC chips ² , the application has the potential to use the NFC chips in modern smartphones to read the signal provided by a card in close proximity to the phone and duplicate the signal to be stored on the application, to be later used through the application. This should work with all cards that use radio frequency identification (RFID) or have an NFC chip if functional. This should be ideal for cards that are used by hotels or businesses and education institutions that use these cards only in physical form. Despite the intent of this functionality is ultimately for convenience, this can easily be abused by many malicious individuals in many malicious use cases. From credit card skimming and fraudulent fraudulent transactions as a result, the universality of this function can be easily used for criminal activity and may even increase unauthorised transactions and crimes as a whole.
                </p>

                <p>Ultimately this function would require a lot of testing and legal consultation so that it can be  effective while also minimising the amount of criminal activity.</p>

                <p>From a business perspective this could be the function that results in the application receiving widespread adoption as there is no other program that does this.</p>

                <p>Despite this mobile function being an innovation, personally, if there is still a slight risk of this function being used in criminal activity, the idea may be scrapped in its entirety to prevent legal repercussions. </p>

                <p> All of that was mentioned prior were ways to store/access your cards in the application, which are the primary functions of the app.</p>

              <h4>Some other QOL functions:</h4>

              <ul>
                <li>Managing and sorting cards through folders</li>
                <li>Removing cards</li>
                <li>Updating cards if they expire or renew</li>
                <li>Track previous payments</li>
                <li>Customizable UI</li>
                <li>Data encryption</li>
                <li>Add to application function supported by businesses own applications for (like “add to apple pay” button)</li>
              </ul>

          <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>

            <p>To develop the application, a mobile internal development environment (IDE) will be required to develop the fundamentals of the application, something like Visual studio would be appropriate (mostly because I am familiar with it), but many IDEs can be suitable for this application for a variety of programming languages like java and python.</p>

            <p>If the application is being developed through Visual studio, windows workstations would be the computers used to develop the app. Local backups will be made regularly on the computer and also on a server, with a cloud storage service used as offsite backups.	</p>

            <p>While this application is going to be primarily used with modern smartphones with NFC chips, the application should still work with phones without NFC chips (with limited functionality). So it's important when doing internal testing that a wide range of phones with different operating systems and hardware specifications (especially older phones without NFC chips) are tested for errors and bugs.</p>

            <p>Also there will be development builds sent to testers regularly for feedback on UX/UI and if any bugs and errors are present in that build.</p>

          <h3>Skills Required</h3>

            <p>There are many skills required to develop this application some of which are quite specialised.</p>

            <p>When developing the application, skills in backend and frontend development is important for fundamentals of mobile applications. Knowledge in a viable programming language for this kind of application is needed to build an application that fulfils all of its requirements.</p>

            <p>Knowledge in how NFC chips and how to utilise them (especially in mobile phones) is key to be able to make transactions and to potentially develop the “direct scan” feature for this application.</p>

            <p>The knowledge on how to store these cards locally on the device so that some features won't require an internet connection (such as nfc data and photos), and the ability to encrypt data so that if the device is stolen people cant access the sensitive data despite having access to the phone</p>

          <h3>Outcome</h3>

            <p>If the project is successful and gains widespread usage, many more businesses will take the application into consideration when developing cards and scannable items so that they can be natively supported on the app. Users will be able to use all their cards and scannable items in one place, solving the issue of the inconvenience of having multiple virtual wallets, making their lives more efficient and potentially making physical wallets less of a need in society. If the development is successful and widely adopted, hopefully most of the cards and scannable items can be natively supported so that app redirection is less of a need so that all your items can be stored in the one app, which is ultimately the vision of the project.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>Thanks for reading through my website. I hope you enjoyed reading or at least found something interesting about me, my ideal job, my personality, or my project. Have a nice day :)</p>
